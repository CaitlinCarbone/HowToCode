            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                In the modern age, coding has become essential in many professions, 
                requiring  workers to understand the fundamentals. However, not all office 
                workers have the luxury of time to take extensive online courses and majority 
                are unlikely to remember everything they learn. Our website strives to address 
                this issue by serving as a widely accessible and easily comprehensible platform.
